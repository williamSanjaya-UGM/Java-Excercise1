will give output 2, because budi doesn't know 1 and 6

caesarCipher: a simple CaesarCipher algorithm, the formula;
E=(p+k) Mod 26, ex:k=3, so: E=(p+3) Mod 26
D=(c-k) Mod 26, ex:k=3, so: D=(c-3) Mod 26

validation: using combinator design pattern to validate Customer registration (also by the help of using regex match pattern)

Tips: some useful stream methods;

1. subList(from idx, to idx)
2. dropWhile(condition)
3. addAll("x","y","z") // will return add value to the lists
4. containsAll("val1","val2","val3") // will return true or false
